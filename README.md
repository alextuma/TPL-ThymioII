By Stefan Teller and Alexander Tuma,
developed in the course of a lecture at the TU in summer semester 2017.


Preperation:
- Install MATLAB R2015b or higher
- Install Aseba Studio (https://www.thymio.org/de:asebalanguage)
- Print and cut the cards (files in the Cards folder)

How to use:
- Create a program by lining up the cards
- Make a picture of them
- Copy the picture to the MATLAB folder of this project
- Connect the Thymio II with USB to the PC
- Open the MATLAB script TPL_ThymioII
- Change the value of Picture_Name to the name of the new picture
- Run the script

In case of an error message in MATLAB, an environment variable on the Windows Computer has to be created:
go to: environment variables -> systemvariables -> new: MATLAB_JAVA - C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_121 (or actual java installation)
